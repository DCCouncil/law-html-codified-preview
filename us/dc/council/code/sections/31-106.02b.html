                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)(B)">(B)</span> A student loan servicer shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this paragraph if the servicer allocates the overpayment to the loan with the highest interest rate on the student loan borrower's account, unless the student loan borrower specifies otherwise.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> A student loan servicer shall transfer to the new student loan servicer for the student education loan all information regarding the student loan borrower, the account of the student loan borrower, and the student education loan of the student loan borrower.
